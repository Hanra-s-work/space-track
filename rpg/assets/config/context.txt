Eve : Hello Dr.Rick, I am Eve your personal assistant. I will accompany you for the ROVER2MD mission.
Eve : Do you want to know the origin of this mission ?
Eve : Before continuing your adventure, I will remind you of some events from the past to refresh your memory.
Eve : 56 years ago, Perseverance landed on Mars.
Eve : Today is the year 2076 and NASA has lost contact with Perseverance for reasons unknown to us.
Eve : Since that day, a new space mission named ROVER2MD has been set up to recover Perseverance.
Eve : Unfortunately, you were not selected to participate in the ROVER2MD mission.
Eve : On your end, you started plotting a lot of theories about this loss of signal.
Eve : It took a toll on your sanity.
Eve : You are only waiting for one thing, it is to participate in the new space mission!
Eve : Whether it's by force or whether you're given the mission, it doesn't matter !
Eve : You will be part of this mission, no matter what !
Eve : Thus comes the day when NASA formalizes and finally announces the creation of the ROVER2MD mission in May 2076.
Eve : Months have passed since this announcement and today is D-Day! The rocket launch is scheduled for 5 p.m.
Eve : Congratulations Dr.Rick! For this escape. Now we can continue our way to the moon.
