Eve : Hello Dr.Rick, I am Eve your personal assistant. I will accompany you for the ROVER2MD mission.
        Do you want to know the origin of this mission?
        Before continuing your adventure, I will remind you of some events from the past to refresh your memory.
        56 years ago, Perseverance landed on Mars.
        Today is the year 2076 and NASA has lost contact with Perseverance for reasons unknown to us.
        Since that day, a new space mission named ROVER2MD has been set up to recover Perseverance.
        Unfortunately, you were not selected to participate in the ROVER2MD mission.
        On your end, you started plotting a lot of theories about this loss of signal.
        It took a toll on your sanity.
        You are only waiting for one thing, it is to participate in the new space mission!
        Whether it's by force or whether you're given the mission, it doesn't matter, you will be part of this mission, no matter what !
        Thus comes the day when NASA formalizes and finally announces the creation of the ROVER2MD mission in August 2076.
        Months have passed since this announcement and today is D-Day! The rocket launch is scheduled for 5 p.m.
Eve : Congratulations Dr.Rick! For this escape. Now we can continue our way to the moon.
