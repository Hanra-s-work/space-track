Eve: Hello Dr.Rick, I am Eve your personal assistant.
Eve: I will accompany you for the ROVER2MD mission.\n
Eve: Do you want to know the origin of this mission ?
VO: Before continuing your adventure, I will remind you of some events from the
VO: past to refresh your memory.
VO: 56 years ago, Perseverance landed on Mars.
VO: Today is the year 2076 and NASA has lost contact with Perseverance for
VO: reasons unknown to us.
VO: Since that day, a new space mission named ROVER2MD has been set up to
VO: recover Perseverance.
VO: Unfortunately, you were not selected to participate in the ROVER2MD mission.
VO: On your end, you started plotting a lot of theories about this loss of
VO: signal.
VO: It took a toll on your sanity.
VO: You are only waiting for one thing, it is to participate in the new space
VO: mission!
VO: Whether it's by force or whether you're given the mission, it doesn't
VO: matter, you will be part of this mission, no matter what !
VO: Thus comes the day when NASA formalizes and finally announces the creation
VO: of the ROVER2MD mission in August 2076.
VO: Months have passed since this announcement and today is D-Day! The rocket
VO: launch is scheduled for 5 p.m.
